                      <p class="fst-italic">Breakfast is the first meal of the day eaten after waking from the night's sleep, in the morning. The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night.There is a strong likelihood for one or more "typical", or "traditional", breakfast menus to exist in most places, but their composition varies widely from place to place, and has varied over time, so that globally a very wide range of preparations and ingredients are now associated with breakfast.</p>

                         <li><b>Ven Pongal</b></li>

Traditionally paired with Sambar and Coconut Chutney, these make for a comforting, filling and satisfying breakfast or snack.</p>
                         <li><b>Idiyappam</b></li>
                         <p>“Idiyappam | String Hopper Recipe | Nool Puttu”. An easy to make and super delicious South Indian steamed rice noodle. Made simply from rice flour, it becomes the perfect vehicle to mop up delicious curry.</p>

Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays.

                        <P>Sambar Rice, quite popular in Tamilnadu hotels as Sambar Sadam is a delicious concoction of rice, dal and mixed vegetables. If you are wondering how is it different from the Karnataka special Bisibelebath, in this recipe we add everything together in one shot into a pressure cooker, cook everything to a mash and then temper it. There is no need for making a special spice blend or roasting pulses, as we use sambar powder there by saving time & effort. As it made in pressure cooker, it just takes 30mins to make it from scratch.</P>

                  <p class="fst-italic">Is less stressful. Rather than driving in traffic, you can use the time that you spend moving from one place to another by bus to do other things, such as reading, advancing some work, taking a nap, listening to music. Travelling by bus is cheaper than owning and operating a car.</p>

    <p class="card-desc">Just like the Royal Enfield motorcycles, the Yamaha RX 100 was once also considered a symbol of masculinity. The two-stroke motorcycle was fast compared to its rivals and had a unique exhaust note. The bike somehow became a favourite amongst the young riders and was kind of wild and rugged in nature.</p>
